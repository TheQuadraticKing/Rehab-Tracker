# Arduino

These are the two ardiuno scripts for the NMES machine. 

The RehabTracker script was written by Sean Kates for testing the BLE connection, the data is hardcoded into the bytes[] array.

The MasterV1 script was written by the SEED team for the actual prototype that they created. I (Sean Kates) have not verified if it works, but the BLE protocol is the same as the test script, and should work similarly if the data is being created successfully.
